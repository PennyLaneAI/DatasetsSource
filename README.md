# Datasets Generator
This repository containing the source code for generating quantum datasets.

The underlying data generation pipelines can be used after installing the above as a `quantum_datasets` module as

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/DatasetsSource
cd DatasetsSource
pip install .
```

Once, the module is installed, one may use the generation methods - `qchem_data_generate` and `qspin_data_generate` for generating datasets for Quantum Chemistry and Quantum Many-body Physics as shown below:

### Code Snippets

For quantum chemistry, you will have to provide it the path for the `XYZ` files. We use a modified version of the standard `XYZ` files, which can be found in the `xyzfiles` folder for reference.

``` python
import quantum_datasets as qd
qd.qchem_data_generate("xyzfiles/q.1-1/schm-1/h2.xyz")
```

The `qchem_data_generate` method accepts the following arguments:
1. ``xyz_path (str)``: absolute path to the `xyz` file containing basic information regarding the molecule
2. ``basis (str)``: basis set (STO-3G, 6-31G or CCVPDZ) used for building the molecule and the electronic hamiltonian
3. ``bondlenths (list)``: list of additional bondlengths used for data generation using the geometry in `geom_struct`
4. ``use_bond_struct (bool)``: whether to use bondlengths of interest in `bond_struct` for PES generation
5. ``folder_path (str)``: absolute path for storing the generated data files

For the quantum spin systems, we have to provide the name of the spin systems (for example: "Ising", "Heisenberg", "FermiHubbard" or "BoseHubbard"), and the periodicity and layout of the lattice.

``` python
import quantum_datasets as qd
qd.qspin_data_generate("Ising", periodicity=True, layout=(1, 4), num_systems=1000)
```

The `qspin_data_generate` method accepts the following arguments:
1. ``sysname (str)``: type of spin model ("Ising", "Heisenberg", "FermiHubbard", "BoseHubbard") for which data has to be generated
2. ``periodicity (bool)``: whether the lattice for the spin model is closed or open
3. ``layout (list/tuple)``: layout for the lattice of the spin model. For example - (1, 8) or (2, 2) 
4. ``num_systems (int)``: number of spins systems generated by varying the model parameters
5. ``folder_path (str)``: absolute path for storing the generated data files

### Datasets
All the datasets will be generated and written under the `datasets` folder with distinct subfolders for `qchem` and `qspin`.
